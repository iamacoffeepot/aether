/// Diagnostic the hub emits back to an originating engine when mail
/// that engine bubbled up (ADR-0037) doesn't resolve at the hub
/// either. Lands on the engine's `aether.diagnostics` sink, which
/// re-warns locally so the unresolved address surfaces in that
/// engine's `engine_logs` rather than only in the hub's. Closes the
/// "typo diagnostics" follow-up from ADR-0037 (issue #185).
///
/// `recipient_mailbox_id` is the hashed mailbox id the originator
/// sent to — the id space is cross-process-stable (ADR-0029 /
/// ADR-0030 / issue #186) so agents can map it back to a name in
/// tooling. `kind_id` is the kind the original mail carried.

/// Issue 607 Phase 4b (ADR-0079): framework-emitted close
/// notification. Sent to every monitor a closing actor accumulated via
/// `NativeCtx::monitor` — the substrate drains `monitors_of[target]`
/// after the target's `unwire` runs, fires one `MonitorNotice` per
/// watcher, and only then flips the target's slot from `Live` to
/// `Dead`.
///
/// The watcher receives this kind as ordinary mail; its `#[handler]`
/// reads `target` to identify which actor it was monitoring. v1 carries
/// only the target id — no `CloseReason` field — so the wire shape is
/// purely additive if a future revision wants to surface trap vs
/// shutdown vs cooperative close.
