//! Substrate lifecycle helpers (ADR-0063).
//!
//! `fatal_abort` is the chassis-facing exit path for abnormal
//! component lifecycle events: a wasm trap or host panic during
//! `deliver`, or a `drain_with_budget` returning `Wedged`. The
//! function logs the abort reason, synchronously flushes the
//! per-actor capture buffers (so the abort log lands in
//! `engine_logs`), and exits the process with code `2`.
//!
//! Issue 775 retired the final `SubstrateDying` broadcast that
//! preceded `process::exit`: with `BroadcastCapability` gone the
//! chassis has no fan-out for the kind, so the abort relies on
//! the log capture path alone.
//!
//! The function is `-> !`. It does not unwind — by the time we're
//! here we've already decided the substrate is going down, and any
//! caller-side cleanup would race the hub's reaping of the engine
//! anyway.
//!
//! [`FatalAborter`] is the indirection that lets call sites that
//! don't naturally hold a [`HubOutbound`] (the cross-class `wait_reply`
//! guard in [`crate::actor::native::binding`], future ADR-0074 §Decision-7
//! checks) request an abort without plumbing outbound through every
//! layer. Production chassis construct an [`OutboundFatalAborter`];
//! tests use [`PanicAborter`] so a misuse panics the test thread
//! instead of `process::exit`-ing the test runner.
