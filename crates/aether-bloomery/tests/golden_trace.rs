//! A scripted bloom driven draft → seal → integrate → resolve → land, replayed
//! from a wire-encoded journal for a byte-identical, pinned decision stream
//! (ADR-0149 migration step 1).
//!
//! The reducer is pure and the value vocabulary is content-addressed, so a
//! fixed journal produces a fixed decision stream. Two things are tested: that
//! the stream is *stable* against a pinned golden digest (a reducer change that
//! silently alters a decided transition trips it), and that replaying the same
//! journal — decoded from wire bytes, the way the host will replay it — yields
//! the identical stream, which is the property that makes the journal
//! replayable and the control plane auditable.
