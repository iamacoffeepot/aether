//! [`OutboundReply`] — per-handler reply surface on top of [`MailSender`].
//!
//! Per-stage capability trait under the issue 663 refactor. Per-handler
//! ctxs (the FFI runtime `Ctx`, substrate's `NativeCtx`) impl this; init
//! and drop ctxs deliberately do not — there's no inbound mail at boot
//! and reply targets are not honoured during teardown.
//!
//! Phase A of issue 663 adds the trait alongside the existing
//! [`crate::actor::sender::MailCtx`] which still backs current call
//! sites; Phase B impls it on the existing ctx types so the trait is
//! reachable everywhere `MailCtx` is reachable; Phase D drops the
//! pre-issue-663 `MailCtx` once the generic-bounds API has converged.
