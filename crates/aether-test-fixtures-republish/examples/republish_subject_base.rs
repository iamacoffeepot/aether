//! Issue 7109: the base `test.republish.subject` module, which each
//! `republish_subject_*` successor republishes with one behavior change.
//!
//! The subject counts the `Bump`s it receives, reporting each as a
//! `TickObserved` to the substrate-harness observer, answers `CountQuery` with
//! a `CountReport`, and carries its count across a replace.
